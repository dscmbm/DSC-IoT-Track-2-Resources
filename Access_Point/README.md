# [ENGLISH] Access Point
In computer networking, a wireless access point (WAP), or more generally just access point (AP), is a networking hardware device that allows a Wi-Fi device to connect to a wired network. The AP usually connects to a router (via a wired network) as a standalone device. In this project we will use an ESP8266 IoT v2.0 board as wireless access point, so we can allows other device like a smartphone, notebook, etc to connect together into ESP8266 device. 

### Assemble the modules following these steps:
1. Upload the [Access Point](/Access_Point/Access_Point) code into ESP8266 IoT V2.0.

if there is no problem so you can start scanning the SSID of your ESP8266 IoT with your mobile devices.
